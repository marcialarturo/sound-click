# Description

Welcome to Sound Click
Sound Click was created for you; the writer, the performer, the beat maker, the producer, the engineer, the record label, the publisher, the videographer, the artist and the CREATOR. Sound Click was built for the person telling their story with music and to find like-minded people to experience it with. Music is the universal language that connects us across the globe. Music brings out our human emotions and music is the unified voice of the people.

An Ecosystem built to support the use and the growth of Music projects by enabling participants to actively get involved in the network via theoretical and interactive educational content provided by the active communities of established Music projects.

Then every 3 months release new functionality to our app until we have a  fully functional app. We are definitely planning to deploy it to the mainnet,  and partner up with nonprofits, government institutions, influencers, and artists.



How we built it

Sound Click application makes use of the following software:
- Polygon Network enables our application to be a scalable platform with fast transactions. We deployed our app on the Mumbai Network.
- Valist facilitated the process of distribution of our in a secure way.
- Unstoppable Domains Sponsored Bounty facilitated the process of authentication and verification of our users in a secure way. Unstoppable allows owners of Unstoppable Domains to log in and share profile information with EVM-compatible applications using the universal Web3 Logins.
- TableLand made our work easy with the Ethereum network. This allows us to work with a relational database to store Employment references and metadata for EVM chains like Ethereum. We will definitely keep using complex TableLand functions in the future.

* `IPFS NFTStorage` for data storage on IPFS that generates a transaction hash used to create an NFT of a photo.

* `NFTPort` smooths the path of the minting and donating process and eliminates the high transaction fees. Our users will not pay anything for donating NFTs or minting.
* `Solidity` for the smart contract.
* `OpenZeppelin ERC721` we use the ERC721 template for faster development of our smart contract.
* `Hardhat` for local blockchain development.
* `React Js, Material-ui, Web3` React Js for the frontend, Material-ui, and Web3 to connect to the blockchain.
